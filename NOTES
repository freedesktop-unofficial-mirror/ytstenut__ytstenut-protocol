Ross: meta-data -> metadata
      relaxng

Damien: should be able to map application to user (not just device, etc.)

        (maybe structured jid <app>.<user>@somewhere)

Robsta: some formfactor and such description


 navigation metadata ?

[13:36] tf> someone pointed out that although we are construing this as
application to application IM, there needs to be some clear mapping between the
applications and actual users
[13:37] tf> so, I am thinking to introduce back the idea of the structured jid,
in the form app.user@somewhere, which should take care of the basics
[13:38] tf> now, there will also need to be some human-friendly info for the
user, which in server context could be accomplished via the vcard
[13:38] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> well
[13:38] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> this actually raises a separate question
i had
[13:38] tf> but I think the vcard does not work with local-xmpp
[13:38] tf> aha
[13:38] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> are we expecting one link-local xmpp
connection per device, or one per application?
[13:38] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> vCard should work with local-xmpp
[13:38] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i think that's how avatars work
[13:39] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i'm wrong, it's not.
[13:39] tf> connection per jid, so that would be per application
[13:40] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> but vcard-temp should work fine on
local-xmpp. or we could also put this information into the disco reply
[13:40] tf> yes
[13:40] tf> that was the other option
[13:40] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> see
http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html#ver-gen-complex for instance: you can
put data forms into the disco reply
[13:40] tf> just wanted to ask what you think, so we avoid creating as much new
stuff as posible
[13:40] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> okay
[13:41] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i had been assuming that we'd have one
connection per device, shared between all applications. making it one per
application makes a lot of things easier, though it could be considered wasteful
[13:42] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> it makes some of the telepathy stuff
redundant... but that's not intrinsically bad :)
[13:42] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> one other option is to put a resource
into the local-xmpp jids
[13:42] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> so user@device/application
[13:43] tf> realistically, I can't see there being many enable apps on a single
device
[13:43] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i don't think this is particularly
common, but i don't see any reason why it shouldn't be legal
[13:43] tf> we need the resouce for like mywordprocessor.myself@local/document1
[13:44] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> hmm
[13:44] tf> now, but using a single connection per device is not out of the
question, I just have hard time to picutre how that would work
[13:45] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i guess my standard analogy is tubes: all
your applications can share the same connection. your caps show which
applications you have installed (you can also have caps saying which
applications are running, etc)
[13:45] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> one pep node per application for its
current status
[13:46] tf> could you sketch that out as an xml snippet ?
[13:46] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> either way is feasible.
[13:46] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> sure, just a minute
[13:46] tf> thx
[13:57] tf> the other thing that came back, I discovered a whole bunch of guys
here at intel who seems to have indepently though of using xmpp for this kind of
a thing, and they are using the ad-hoc commands extension for the command
exchanges; this got me back to wonder if the instruction messages should not be
exchanged using that
[13:58] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> hah, parallel evolution
[13:58] tf> seems like it
[13:58] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i don't see any particular problem with
using that extension... it's not perfect, but it would do
[13:58] tf> it's a standard already, and in many ways it does what we need it to
do
[13:59] tf> also, the xforms are very extensible
[13:59] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> yep
[13:59] tf> I gather TP does not support that currently ?
[13:59] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> we already have code for building and
parsing them
Fri 26 Nov 2010 14:00
[14:00] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> we don't have D-Bus APIs for the custom
commands xep though
[14:00] tf> but if we used that, you would end up with a bit more of the
standard xmpp suported in TP, which can't be a bad thing either
[14:01] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> right!
[14:01] tf> I am just thinking that what is in the nscreen spec is susipicously
like that in some respects
[14:01] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i think the only difference is that it
doesn't have the first step to retrieve the form fields
[14:02] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> the only substantial difference, i mean
[14:03] tf> yeah, but you would not need to do that; the <command/> field can
hold arbitrary xml according to the spec, and if we define standard xforms for
certain capabilites, the first step could be just skipped
[14:03] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> that should be fine
[14:04] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> the only problem is that, as specified,
executing XEP-0050 commands needs a sessionid=''
[14:04] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> oh no, it doesn't
[14:04] tf> right, I need to re-read that
[14:05] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> none of the examples show it, but i don't
see any reason why we couldn't just shove an xform into the initial <command/>
node in http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html#execute-simple
[14:06] tf> cool, I will look into changing that part of the draft in that
direction
[14:06] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> col
[14:19] tf> ok, I need to read through that bug report and the associated
documents :-)
[14:19] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> the bug report is really long
[14:19] tf> but just looking at the xml
[14:20] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> that was more for future reference than
anything else
[14:20] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> it had completely slipped my mind :)
[14:21] tf> if we have a single connection per-device, how do you we go about
multiple applications with identical capability on the same device ?
[14:21] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> hm
[14:21] tf> and, could two applications on the same device still talk to each
other ?
[14:22] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> for the first: i hadn't considered that
possibility. what's the use case? it should be workable, just thinking about it
[14:23] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> for the second: yes, that should work
fine. For the per-application extended status, all the other Telepathy API
exposes your own status in the same way as your contacts', so that should work
without extra work. For sending commands, we'd have to explicitly add a
pass-through, but that should also work
[14:26] tf> right; this probably not the most important thing, but some of the
use cases we are looking at is one application watching the extended status of
another and presenting the user with some extra information based on that status
[14:28] tf> say you are watching the Matrix, and there is another app that
automatically build a list of webpages that you might be interested in; this
could be on the same device, though most of then elsewhere
[14:28] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> ah, nice
[14:29] tf> having a single jabber connection makes sense, as long as we can
still make specific apps talk to each other
[14:30] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> with multiple apps with the same caps,
this is possible, too: the PEP events/items would be published at the node for
the caps, and the payload would contain application info; there would be more
than one <nscreen:status/> element in the <item> if there's more than one
application with these caps
[14:30] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> yeah, it shouldn't stop specific apps
communicating at all
[14:31] tf> right, I need to think this through, that's quite a mental shift for
me, but I think I like it
[14:31] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> i actually don't think it will change the
protocol very much
[14:32] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> it mainly affects the D-Bus API design â€”
I started writing about it while writing that proposal :)
[14:32] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> erm. thinking about it.

[14:39] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> of course, it'd be nice if we also
supported http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0118.html and friends where appropriate
[14:40] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> but this is out of scope for this project
[14:40] tf> yes, though if we are going to conceptually move to a single device
connection, this becomes more relevant
[14:41] tf> then the contection represents a person
[14:41] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> (also,
http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0108.html#activities might amuse: they attempt to
define all of the possible activities a person might be doing...)
[14:41] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> right, we could think about re-using the
existing Salut connection
[14:42] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> erm, i mean, share the same connection
used for link-local IM
[14:42] tf> excellent; this is what I want to avoid; I mean to define everything
[14:42] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> but do you really want IM presence for
all your devices showing up in iChat when your friend brings their macbook over?
[14:42] tf> no
[14:42] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> actually things get difficult if the user
doesn't want to be available for chat, but they do want their applications to be
communicating
[14:43] tf> we don't want to reuse the human IM connection
[14:43] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> yep, totalyl
[14:43] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> a different project i was involved with
made this mistake at first
[14:43] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> and we ended up with
http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/Account_Interface_Minimum_Presence.html to
have some way to have orthogonal presence for IM and the background service on
the same connection
[14:44] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> happily, the decision was made to stop
sharing the connection
[14:44] tf> I realized we do not want to do that when my test apps started
appearing in my IM roster when I was playing with local-xmpp
[14:44] tf> ok, I got lot's of food for though, I will try to produce a revised
version of the spec document early next week
[14:45] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> great
[14:45] tf> many thanks
[14:45] will.thompson@collabora.co.uk> ditto: this has clarified a lot of things
in my head :)
